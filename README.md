I'm excited to share that I've created a new game! ðŸŽ®

 The first step is to enter your name, which I store in a loop to make sure you don't skip it. Your name is then converted to uppercase for that extra touch of epicness.

In the game, you'll choose one of three opponents to fight: Skull, Zombie, or Ninja.

You'll get detailed info about your name and fuel, as well as your opponent's stats.

During the fight, if your fuel decreases, you'll have the option to increase it.

At the end of the battle, the game will tell you who wins and who loses.
  
There's also an option to "Run for Life," which ends the game and says, "You lose. Better luck next time!"
